## Personal Reflection

From having one day to assemble a team to the collective shock when we heard our team called in the final round, the journey of Datafest is one I will always remember. The odds seemed against us: first and only UCSB team to be at Datafest with no prior experience in hackathons.

Despite the technical challenges, our team was held together by our pure curiosity of the data. We could not sleep that first night. They had just handed us the dataset and our minds were racing with different angles and visualizations to apply. But after a traffic congested drive from SB, sleep was essential for our next day of “hacking.” So we hit the hay…and dreamed about the data.
